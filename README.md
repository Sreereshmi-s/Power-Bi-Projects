This repository contains the steps and methodology for performing various operations and creating powerful visualizations in Power BI, using the Global Superstore Dataset. The project demonstrates how to connect to a database, clean and transform data, and create insightful visualizations and reports in Power BI.

## Dataset Overview:
The Global Superstore Dataset is a comprehensive collection of records that capture sales, orders, and customer information across various regions and product categories. It includes details about order IDs, product categories, customer, sales, profits, and shipping information.

## DataSet Name: Global Superstore

### Step 1: Database Connection: Import the Global Superstore Dataset from Excel.

### Step 2: Data Analysis and Cleaning:
#### Explore the Dataset:
Investigate the tables and their columns to understand the data structure and identify any potential data quality issues.
#### Handle Missing Values:
Identify columns with missing data and decide whether to remove or impute missing values (e.g., using the Power Query Editor).
#### Remove Duplicates:
Identify any duplicate records and remove them as needed to ensure data integrity.
#### Address Data Quality Issues:
Check for any inconsistencies or outliers in the dataset and apply necessary transformations or filters to clean the data.

### Step 3: Data Transformation using Power Query and DAX:
Applying the necessary data transformations to ensure data consistency and usability. Utilize Power Query Editor and DAX functions to clean and refine the data.

### Step 4: Data Visualization and Report Creation
After cleaning and transforming the data, create interactive visualizations to analyze the performance of the Global Superstore. Some of the key analysis in the dashboard are:
- Sales Trends over time
- Sales by market
- Orders by shipmode
- Top 5 cities by sales
- Top 5 states by sales
- Profit by category
- Sales by regions
